- test large leaf stuff
- call close from table tests
- test for user-defined comparison
- test nontrivial selection predicate
- test writing to table while iterating
- test select expiration
- test deletion, both immediate and after flushing to file

- test osmos_file merge, merge_delete
- test empty osmos_file
- test select_continue after end
- (somehow) test select with empty tree, or tree where all values are
  below range
- (somehow) test select where whole files (incl. tree) tend to be all
  greater or less than each other, to hit edge cases
- apparently not yet testing iter_next_least (always short-circuiting
  before hitting files?)
- test reading duplicate keys in journal (write dupes before hitting
  disk, then close)
